# OpenViking Memory Provider

Context database by Volcengine (ByteDance) with filesystem-style knowledge hierarchy, tiered retrieval, and automatic memory extraction.

## Requirements

- OpenViking installed with the `openviking-server` command available
- OpenViking server config initialized and validated (`openviking-server init`,
  then `openviking-server doctor`)
- OpenViking server running and reachable from Hermes

## Setup

Prepare OpenViking first:

```bash
openviking-server init
openviking-server doctor
openviking-server
```

Then configure Hermes:

```bash
hermes memory setup    # select "openviking"
```

The setup can link to an existing `~/.openviking/ovcli.conf`, copy its current
connection values into Hermes, or create a minimal `ovcli.conf` when one does
not exist.

Or manually:

```bash
hermes config set memory.provider openviking
```

Add the connection settings to the active profile's `.env` file. For the
default profile that is `~/.hermes/.env`; for a named profile use
`~/.hermes/profiles/<profile>/.env`.

```text
OPENVIKING_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:1933
# OPENVIKING_API_KEY=...
# OPENVIKING_ACCOUNT=default
# OPENVIKING_USER=default
# OPENVIKING_AGENT=hermes
OPENVIKING_IDENTITY_MODE=solo
```

## Config

OpenViking's server config is separate from Hermes:

- `ov.conf` configures OpenViking storage, embedding/VLM models, auth, and
  server behavior. OpenViking reads it from `--config`,
  `OPENVIKING_CONFIG_FILE`, or `~/.openviking/ov.conf`.
- `ovcli.conf` stores client/CLI connection values such as `url`, `api_key`,
  `account`, and `user`. It is read from `OPENVIKING_CLI_CONFIG_FILE` or
  `~/.openviking/ovcli.conf`.

Hermes-side provider config is read from environment variables in the active
profile's `.env`:

| Env Var | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `OPENVIKING_ENDPOINT` | `http://127.0.0.1:1933` | Server URL |
| `OPENVIKING_API_KEY` | (none) | User/admin API key for authenticated servers |
| `OPENVIKING_ACCOUNT` | `default` | Tenant account for local/trusted mode |
| `OPENVIKING_USER` | `default` | Tenant user for local/trusted mode |
| `OPENVIKING_AGENT` | `hermes` | Hermes peer ID in OpenViking, used for peer-scoped memories |
| `OPENVIKING_IDENTITY_MODE` | `solo` | `solo` for one human or `team` for messaging gateways |
| `OPENVIKING_IDLE_COMMIT_SECONDS` | `900` | Extract an idle session after this many seconds; `0` disables idle checkpoints |
| `OPENVIKING_IDLE_COMMIT_KEEP_RECENT` | `0` | Messages left unarchived by an idle checkpoint |

When `OPENVIKING_API_KEY` is set, Hermes lets OpenViking derive account/user
identity from the key. In local or trusted deployments without an API key,
Hermes sends `OPENVIKING_ACCOUNT` and `OPENVIKING_USER` as identity headers.

### Team Mode

Team mode is intended for a single Hermes profile used by multiple people
across messaging channels:

- Every human message is tagged with a stable peer ID derived from the
  platform's immutable user identity.
- Assistant messages omit `peer_id`, so OpenViking treats them as self memory
  in the parent user namespace.
- Retrieval uses the whole configured OpenViking user namespace. This lets one
  Hermes colleague use what it has learned across chats while preserving the
  original human attribution on extracted memories.
- Unaddressed group messages may be observed without running the agent. They
  are synchronized on the next addressed turn with their original speakers.

Team mode requires gateway sender identity and intentionally refuses to run in
the Hermes CLI. Run `hermes memory setup` again and choose Solo for CLI use.

OpenViking extracts session memories when a session is committed. The idle
checkpoint makes short, quiet gateway sessions searchable without ending the
Hermes session. It is a provider-local checkpoint and does not evict or rebuild
the warm agent.

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `viking_search` | Semantic search with fast/deep/auto modes |
| `viking_read` | Read content at a viking:// URI (abstract/overview/full) |
| `viking_browse` | Filesystem-style navigation (list/tree/stat) |
| `viking_remember` | Store a fact directly with OpenViking `content/write` |
| `viking_forget` | Delete one exact `viking://` memory file URI |
| `viking_add_resource` | Ingest URLs/docs into the knowledge base |

## Memory Writes And Deletes

`viking_remember` writes directly to OpenViking with `POST /api/v1/content/write`
and `mode=create`. In Solo mode it writes under the configured agent peer. In
Team mode, `owner=human` writes under the active human peer and `owner=self`
writes to the parent user memory namespace. OpenViking may return canonical
user-scoped forms in API-key mode. Explicit remembers do not depend on session
commit extraction.

Hermes built-in `memory` tool additions are mirrored to OpenViking after the
local memory operation succeeds:

| Hermes action | OpenViking operation |
|---------------|----------------------|
| `add` | `content/write` with `mode=create` under the configured peer memory namespace |

Built-in `replace` and `remove` operations are not mirrored because Hermes
native memory entries do not yet carry stable OpenViking file URIs. Use
`viking_forget` when the user explicitly asks to delete a specific OpenViking
memory URI.

`viking_forget` is intentionally narrow. It only accepts concrete user memory
file URIs, such as
`viking://user/peers/hermes/memories/preferences/mem_abc123.md` or the canonical
`viking://user/default/peers/hermes/memories/preferences/mem_abc123.md`. Files
directly under `memories/`, such as `viking://user/default/memories/profile.md`,
are also allowed because OpenViking supports them. The tool rejects directories,
resources, skills, sessions, generated summary files, and URIs with query
strings or fragments. Use OpenViking's MCP, CLI, or admin APIs for broader
resource and directory cleanup.
